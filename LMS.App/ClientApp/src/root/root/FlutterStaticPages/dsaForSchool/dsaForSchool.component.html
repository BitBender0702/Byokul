              qualifications and scope of which are specified in Article 8 of the
              contract, and the provision and use of services in exchange for the
              purchase of indefinite-term monthly billed subscription service
              (monthly plan), annual subscription service providing 12-month
              access period (annual plan), and other subscription services
              providing fixed-term access (other subscription plans).

              &nbsp;20% of the income of the virtual schools you have established
              is deducted as a commission by the BYOKUL Virtual Digital Platform
              Tic. Ltd. Şti. The remaining amount is paid by us to your account
              between the 1st and 5th of each month.

              <li><strong> RENOVATION OF SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In accordance with the law, we will not renew your fixed-term
              subscription services without your prior approval. An example of
              this is the annual plan, which provides access for 12 months. The
              prepaid subscription service (monthly plan), which is billed monthly
              for an indefinite period, is automatically renewed in the same
              period of each month following the purchase date, unless you cancel
              it, and your registered credit card will be charged. If you don't
              want your subscription to renew next month, you can cancel your
              subscription plan in my account. When you cancel your monthly plan
              subscription service, you can access BYOKUL throughout the balance
              plan period.
            </p>
            <p>Monthly Plan Payment Trial</p>
            <p>
              At the renewal period of your monthly plan that you have not
              canceled, an attempt is made to collect the relevant fee from your
              payment instrument. If payment is not received on the first try,
              BYOKUL is kept open to your access for a while, and the payment is
              tried to be collected. If payment is not received despite trial
              efforts, the subscription service you purchased ends. You can
              purchase subscription service again by logging into your account.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong> PAYMENT </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We collect the fee of the subscription service subject to the
              contract through the payment institution from the credit/debit card
              you provide on the payment page. If you purchase a monthly plan and
              do not cancel your subscription before the renewal period, the
              automatic collection is made from the relevant credit card. In case
              the fee cannot be received due to insufficient balance, we'll try to
              get paid within 10 business days. During this time, you can access
              the services subject to sale. However, if we do not receive payment
              for a period of time, we close the services.

              We may change the monthly plan fees for your next renewal period. We

              information regarding the conditions of participation in the form of

              this contract. Third parties who access BYOKUL through you within
              the scope of the campaigns must comply with the Terms of Use.

              terminate this contract and to terminate your right to access the
              content on BYOKUL as of the termination date. In cases where you
              purchase a subscription service (monthly plan) billed monthly for an
              indefinite period, you may terminate this contract at any time by
              canceling your subscription. When you cancel your monthly plan, you
              can access the services offered within the scope of the service you
              purchased during your balance plan term.
